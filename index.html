                        I have worked for an insurance company for the past 9 years in Auto and Homeowners claims. 
                        The past 2.5 years, I have served as a Team Manager for Claims Associates.  I have a passion for building things,
                        and helping others. I am currently enrolled in the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp to pursue a career as a Full-Stack developer.
                        I graduated from Maryville University with a B.S in Sports Business Management. In addition to Coding Bootcamp, I am pursuing a 
                        masters degree in Software Development from Maryville University as well to be completed following the completion of Coding Bootcamp.

                        I am a resident of Phoenix, Arizona for the past 5 years. I recently (April, 2018) married the love of my life Tiffany.
                        We enjoy traveling together and exploring different parts of the beautiful earth. I am a sports fanatic!  I can watch just
                        about any sporting event. I love the atmosphere of attending a game in-person. I root for the St. Louis Cardinals, Duke Blue Devils. 
                        Some of my hobbies include: golfing, hiking, slowpitch softball and working out. 
                        My dream job would be to become a developer for a Sports team, league or a company in the Sports industry. 
                        Please contact me if you want to talk about development, sports or anything in between!
